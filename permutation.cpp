/*
Backtracking- 
it's an algorithmic technique for solving problem recursively
it search every possible combination in order to solvea computational problem.
There are three types of problems in backtracking –  
Decision Problem – In this, we search for a feasible solution.
Optimization Problem – In this, we search for the best solution.
Enumeration Problem – In this, we find all feasible solutions.

solving all sub-problems one by one in order to reach the best possible solution. 

In recursion, the function calls itself until it reaches a base case. In backtracking, we use recursion to explore all the possibilities until we get the best result for the problem.
